        'body':'we saw how to begin building a basic RESTful web server with Flask, limited to GET requests. This allowed retrieval of a dataset and some of its subsets. For most visualizations, the constraint that data be passively consumed, not altered, is acceptable,1 but even allowing for this, a lot of fairly basic stuff was missing (e.g., the ability to paginate retrieved data, allowing you to control the size of responses from the server). In this chapter, we’ll see two Flask RESTful plugins that add this functionality and a whole lot more for the price of a few lines of Python. I think you’ll be impressed by how much web API can be rolled with so little.',
